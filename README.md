# NgFlix

Hello! This is [ngFLix](https://ngflix.chriscurley.dev) :)

ngFlix is an Angular frontend that uses data pulled from TMDB to populate its various pages and components. Overall, it is a simple movie site similar to IMDB with the styling of Netflix.

The site will let you see an assortment of popular, upcoming, and top rated movies and TV shows. Clicking any of the titles will bring you to a screen featuring technical details about the film/TV show's production and cast, as well as media related to it and similar movies or TV shows.

There is also a search feature nestled within the Movies and TV Shows pages that you can navigate to from the header of the page.

Aside from using the built in Angular features, I made use of the PrimeNG component library for carousels, image previews, and many other things.
